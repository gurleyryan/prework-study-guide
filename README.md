# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

When learning something new it can be helpful to keep track of acquired information through detailed note-taking. Since HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are new to me and many others, I built this study guide to organize my notes. By doing so, I helped mitigate the issue of forgetting an overload of information, and I learned the basics of building a rudimentary webpage.

## Usage

The Prework topics are separated into four sections: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section contains bulleted notes on the respective topic for the user to study. By opening the DevTools console - Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), the user can see a list of the topics along with a randomly chosen topic to study.
