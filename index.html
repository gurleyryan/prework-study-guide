        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable (var) is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>The var keyword declares a variable, followed by the uniquely named container.</li>
          <li>The assignment operator = assigns the specific data stored in a variable, followed by the uniquely named data.</li>
          <li>A string is a series of data contained within quotation marks, which is assigned to a variable. Numbers and Boolean values do not need quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>The word "console" in console.log refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. </li>
          <li>A method, such as .log(), is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript has a top-down control flow.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops can alter the control flow.</li>
          <li>The conditional statement "if" requires specified conditions to be met for the code to execute.</li>
          <li>The conditional statement "else if" specifies alternate conditions under which the code will execute</li>
          <li>A falsy value is 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>A truthy value is any other value, including a Boolean with the value of true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>An index is a unique number that identifies the location of data within an array. In JavaScript, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. The index is added to the end of an array name in square brackets (console.log(shapes[0]);).</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through all of the data in our array and log them to the console until there is no data left. In order to use the for loop, we need the data's index and the array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements: The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0). The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
            <ul> 
              <li>for(var x = 0; x < data.length; x++) {<br>
            console.log(data[x]);<br>
           }</li>
          </ul>
